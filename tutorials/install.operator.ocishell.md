# Install and configure the operator

## Introduction

An operator is an application-specific controller that extends Kubernetes to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications. The Oracle WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator (the "operator") simplifies the management and operation of WebLogic domains and deployments.

This lab walks you through the steps to prepare OCI Cloud shell (client) environment and install WebLogic Kubernetes Operator.

## **STEP 1**: Clone the operator repository to a Cloud Shell instance
First, clone the operator git repository to OCI Cloud Shell.
```bash
<copy>git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator.git -b v3.0.0</copy>
```
The output should be similar to the following:
```bash
Cloning into 'weblogic-kubernetes-operator'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 606, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (606/606), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (315/315), done.
remote: Total 157642 (delta 271), reused 429 (delta 168), pack-reused 157036
Receiving objects: 100% (157642/157642), 111.14 MiB | 13.26 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (92756/92756), done.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b new_branch_name

Checking out files: 100% (10812/10812), done.
```
## **STEP 2**: Prepare the Kubernetes environment
Kubernetes distinguishes between the concept of a user account and a service account for a number of reasons. The main reason is that user accounts are for humans while service accounts are for processes, which run in pods. The operator also requires service accounts.  If a service account is not specified, it defaults to `default` (for example, the namespace's default service account). If you want to use a different service account, then you must create the operator's namespace and the service account before installing the operator Helm chart.

Thus, create the operator's namespace in advance:
```bash
<copy>kubectl create namespace sample-weblogic-operator-ns</copy>
```
Create the service account:
```bash
<copy>kubectl create serviceaccount -n sample-weblogic-operator-ns sample-weblogic-operator-sa</copy>
```
Finally, add a stable repository to Helm, which will be needed later for 3rd party services.
```bash
<copy>helm repo add traefik https://containous.github.io/traefik-helm-chart/</copy>
```
## **STEP 3**: Install the operator using Helm
Before you execute the operator `helm` install, make sure that you are in the operator's local Git repository folder.
```bash
<copy>cd ~/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/</copy>
```
Use the `helm install` command to install the operator Helm chart. As part of this, you must specify a "release" name for their operator.

You can override the default configuration values in the operator Helm chart by doing one of the following:

- Creating a [custom YAML](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator/blob/v3.0.0/kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator/values.yaml) file containing the values to be overridden, and specifying the `--values` option on the Helm command line.
- Overriding individual values directly on the Helm command line, using the `--set` option.

Using the last option, simply define overriding values using the `--set` option.

Note the values:

- **name**: The name of the resource.
- **namespace**: Where the operator is deployed.
- **image**: The prebuilt operator 3.0.0 image, available on the public Docker hub.
- **serviceAccount**: The service account required to run the operator.
- **domainNamespaces**: The namespaces where WebLogic domains are deployed in order to control them. Note, the WebLogic domain is not deployed yet, so this value will be updated when namespaces are created for WebLogic deployment.

Execute the following `helm install`:
```bash
<copy>helm install sample-weblogic-operator \
  kubernetes/charts/weblogic-operator \
  --namespace sample-weblogic-operator-ns \
  --set image=oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator:3.0.0 \
  --set serviceAccount=sample-weblogic-operator-sa \
  --set "domainNamespaces={}"</copy>
```
The output will be similar to the following:
```bash
NAME: sample-weblogic-operator
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Sep  3 13:48:24 2020
NAMESPACE: sample-weblogic-operator-ns
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
```
Check the operator pod:
```bash
<copy>kubectl get po -n sample-weblogic-operator-ns</copy>
```
The output will be similar to the following:
```bash
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
weblogic-operator-67d66b4576-jkp9g   1/1     Running   0          41s
```
Check the operator Helm chart:
```bash
<copy>helm list -n sample-weblogic-operator-ns</copy>
```
The output will be similar to the following:
```bash
NAME                            NAMESPACE                       REVISION        UPDATED                                 STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION
sample-weblogic-operator        sample-weblogic-operator-ns     1               2020-09-03 13:48:24.187689635 +0000 UTC deployed        weblogic-operator-3.0.0
```

The WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator has been installed. You can continue with next tutorial module.
